ADVANCED CSS: FLEXBOX AND CSS TRANSITIONS

In this project, I created a fictional tea shop website using HTML and CSS.

Codecademy provided a design spec and image assets. 

A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. 

/* ---------- UPDATE ---------- */

I used this project to try my hand at Bootstrap for the first time. I wanted to make the page more responsive. Spent the day on it. Ran into a bug with the card images being strectched vertically in Edge and Chrome on one phone but not another. I had an img width setting that I forgot about.
